# BoatAssetManager
Task: Create a boat components tracking tool

Each boat component (mast, hull, rudder, etc ...) can be defined by its mass and centre of mass (x,y,z). Create a simple web app (no need for the data to persist out of the session scope, i.e. no need to have a server / database) to create / edit / delete these components. The boat's total mass and centre of mass will need to be calculated and displayed, and updated when a component is added or deleted. The UI should be reasonably good-looking and straightforward to use.

You can of course make use of any open-source library and/or JavaScript framework that may help you achieve that task. You'll be expected to show and explain how your app works, how you structured your code and what choices you made!

Additionally, you may have a go at one of the following bonus tasks (or at least think about the way you would implement the relevant feature):

Bonus 1: Add a 'read-only' mode so that the components and components list cannot be edited by default
Bonus 2: Add sorting on each column so that items can be sorted by weight or coordinate. Optional: add filters
Bonus 3: Add a chart to plot the component (and boat)'s COGs on the YZ plane. Optional: drag and drop components to move them around ...


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
